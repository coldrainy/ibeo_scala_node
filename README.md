# ibeo_scala_node
ROS node for ibeo scala lidar.
This package could only be built successfully after building the ibeoSDK.
Please reference to the ibeo website(http://www.ibeo-as.com/) to get ibeoSDK, an ibeo account is necessary to download the sdk. 

#catkin_make
Need to adjust the "include_directories" and "target_link_libraries" in CMakeList.txt.
